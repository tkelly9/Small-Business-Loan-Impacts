#### Linear Regression Models

Linear Regression model and correlation matrix show that the number of full-time employees at the time of the loan closure is positively correlated with the number of jobs retained as a direct result of the loan.



Multiple linear regression model shows that SSBCI Original Funds, Concurrent Private Financing, Guaranteed Amount, Full Time Employees, and Jobs Created are the strongest predictors for the number of Jobs Retained.
